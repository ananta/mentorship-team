# Node.js Mentorship Program

### Why I would like to join the mentorship team?

I started javascript with the Node.js ecosystem. Before all of this, I wasn't a big fan of Javascript which was only used for frontend interactions.
But when I found out about Node.js and all the possibilities it carries, it was a game-changer for me.
Even big companies like Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, Netflix, Facebook started adopting Node.js largely.
Node.js has seriously helped me in my career to become a full-stack developer I am today.
I am able to build/develop full-stack applications from the Node ecosystem using Amazing frameworks & libraries like Express, Koa, Socket.io, Passport,
Mocha, Jasmine, Chai, Electron, React-Native, and so on(literally so many)...
Even a text editor like VSCode that I use every day is made in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).)

I have been using Node.js for a long time but I am not able to give back to the Node community. Applying to this opportunity will fill the void for giving
back to the community. I am passionate about the Node.js ecosystem and I'm willing to learn and
contribute to its growth and development. Plus, being a mentee to world-class engineers will be one of the pride to carry throughout my journey as a developer.

I have a good understanding of working with SCM like [git](https://git-scm.com/) and hosting platforms like [Github](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
As I have been in the tech industry as a [Freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~012dc6ff0297c51a40), I do have
good technical & communication skills! and I am always trying to improve them as my career progresses.

I will be graduating this summer! Getting to learn from industry leaders and world-class software engineers right after my graduation will for sure give a boost to my career.
I have been using git and GitHub in day-to-day life but haven't been able to know how it's like to maintain a big open-sourced project. I do have some technical skills but lack
project management skills. This will help for sure to fill the void in my management skills.
